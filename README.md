This is my political plan for planet Earth. 

"In the 1880's, \[Otto von\] Bismarck worked on preventing the spread of Socialism \[Communism\] by creating a welfare state, establishing national healthcare, accident insurance, and old age pensions \[what we now call 'Social Security' and 'Social Security Disability Insurance' in the USA\]"

We must combat the spread of Communism by improving and modernizing such programs for all people in all countries! To hell (the Hell Fire, ðŸŒž) with Bolshevism!

In addition, with regard to the notion of Universal Basic Income, or UBI, I would accept it only if it applied to all people on planet Earth, it required making an account with the government such as https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/ , and it were limited to one United States dollar per year, which could be collected at any point during the year or would be automatically moved into your bank account at the end of the year if you do not withdraw your dollar. If you do not make an account, you lose the dollar. It is one US dollar regardless of whether you live in the United States or central Africa, where people earn a US dollar or two each day. Basically, it would be a free day off work for people in central Africa, but only if they make an account.
